        "body": "I am roughly $30k in credit card debt. About a year ago I had left my job and applied for two credit cards and stated on the application I was employed. I have several other cards that have defaulted but those applications were accurate, the ouch they were close to maxed at the time. I had money from my retirement that I was using to pay my bills and pay more than the minimum balance believing I would soon be employed with similar income. I finally got a job a few months later, but with a significant pay cut. After a couple of months I realized I wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep up with everything (cards maxed out at this point) so I enrolled in a debt relief program (changed midstream to another company). This has ruined my credit and now I am considering filing for bankruptcy. I haven\u2019t paid my credit cards in 6 months. How likely is it that they will discover I wasn\u2019t truthful on my applications during the bankruptcy process, and if so, how likely is it that I will be prosecuted and go to jail? I know I\u2019ve made a lot of stupid mistakes, but honestly thought I could handle the debt. I think bankruptcy is the best option if the risk is low, otherwise I may have to continue this way",

I\u2019m wondering what will be the ramifications. He said we will be able to stay in the home, continue to make payments, they will not be able to foreclose, and her name will drop off the loan. He just told us we need to continue making payments as usual.\nDoes this sound right? I can\u2019t imagine a bank going through all the trouble of making sure a couple has enough money to afford a home just to not care that one person is getting off the loan.

For that reason, the lender will happily continue to receive and apply payments to the loan in accordance with its terms, as its lien created by the deed of trust will \"ride through\" the bankruptcy without becoming impaired.\n\nHomesteads have no significance in this situation, since the homestead does not take priority over the consensual lien given to secure the loan. Homesteads are effective against involuntary liens, such as judgment liens.\n\nIn addition, even in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding I have never seen a bankruptcy judge approve a reaffirmation agreement for residential real property in my 44 years of practice. While the judge's approval is not required in the event that the debtor's attorney certifies that entering into the reaffirmation agreement will not result in a hardship to the borrower, there really is no need to reaffirm the loan, except for credit reporting purposes.",

The homestead exemption in Los Angeles County for 2023 was appx. $678,000 in equity, but the numbers for 2024 are not available until around the 20th of January each year. Given last year's poor real estate market, this number could actually go down. However, other factors, such as when you purchased the home may limit that homestead exemption amount also - this is often missed by attorneys who are inexperienced or who dabble in bankruptcy and who do not stay current on the changes in the law. I've had to take over numerous cases where the attorneys missed this issue and the trustee was going to force the sale of the home because of that error.\n\n4. We never reaffirm homes in California. California has an anti-deficiency statute. You keep making your payments and they cannot show your home loan as defaulted due to the bankruptcy. They may quit reporting it on your credit, but there's nothing anyone can do about that because they are not required to report anything. Reaffirmation agreements help the lenders not the borrowers.\n\n5. Not sure what you mean by \"getting off the loan.\" Bankruptcy does not remove anyone from the loan. It just discharges personal liability. The bank will still have its lien on the home and that will always needs to be paid or it can foreclose.\n\nHappy to help.",

People who are working full-time and in the early stages of a career are probably not good candidates for this type of discharge.\n\nIf you have federal student loans, apply for income-based repayment aka IBR or IDR, which will make the payment a percentage of your disposable income.

Unless there there is some reason otherwise, you should have received your discharge or your case closed, in which case there is no automatic stay in effect anymore, and a secured creditor continuing a simple Deed of Trust foreclosure is not a violation of the discharge stay.\nIf you are in a chapter 13 the stay applies during the 3 to 5 year span of the plan. Assuming you are in a chapter 13, I will address your question. Most courts view the continuation of a sale as \"administrative\" and therefore not a violation of the automatic stay.

This is a forum for non-case specific questions because attorneys cannot give specific advice on media platforms. So, what I can say is that bankruptcy is one of the best ways to responsibly handle debt. It can help protect assets, save businesses, eliminate tax debt/tax problems, and help you to re-establish good credit much quicker than any other means.\n\nSome cons could be that you may have non-exempt assets that could be sold to pay your creditors. However, you will know this before filing and can decide if the asset is something you care about keeping or not. If you want to keep the asset, you can make a deal with the trustee. Another con is that the bankruptcy will be on your credit for 7-10 years, but that does NOT prevent you from getting new credit. You have to wait 3 years to get a conventional mortgage loan, but you only have to wait 12 months get get an FHA loan.\n\nBankruptcy is not what most people believe. Most people hear rumors or read social media posts that are just plain wrong. Get a consultation with a reputable CA State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Specialist. Most of us offer a free consultation and will give you a recommendation based on your circumstances. If you have the amount of debt you have, you need to meet with someone soon. Best wishes!",

          "answer_text": "Foreclose is a term that applies to secured real estate transactions, such as mortgages. So, if the LLC has financed a real estate purchase, the lender can foreclose on the real estate. However, I am guessing you want to know whether an LLC can be ATTACHED by a judgment creditor of one of the owners of the LLC.\n\nIn Nevada, state exemption laws protect business entities such as LLCs, but I am unaware California offers such protection to its residents. Accordingly, a judgment creditor can probably rip the LLC to shreds with some effort. Hope this perspective helps!",

          "answer_text": "In California, a creditor generally cannot foreclose on a debtor's Single Member LLC to satisfy a debt, such as a credit card debt, after obtaining a default judgment. Single Member LLCs are considered separate legal entities, and California law typically protects the personal assets of the LLC owner from being used to satisfy the LLC's debts. However, there are exceptions and certain circumstances where creditors may attempt to pierce the corporate veil and go after the personal assets of the LLC owner, but this is not common and requires specific legal criteria to be met.\n\nCreditors usually pursue other collection methods, like garnishing bank accounts or placing liens on other assets, rather than trying to foreclose on a Single Member LLC. Foreclosure on an LLC is a more complex and less common process compared to foreclosure on real property.\n\nIt's essential for debtors to consult with an attorney who can provide advice tailored to their specific situation, as the outcome can vary depending on various factors and legal nuances. Consulting a legal professional will help you understand the best course of action for your specific case.",

Funds in a bank account can be levied by the creditor if the account is in the name of the judgment debtor.\n\nTo access property owned by a business entity, the creditor would have to \"pierce the corporate veil\" by proving the the business entity is the \"alter ego\" of the judgment debtor. This requires a significant investment of time and effort, and is therefore unlikely in the typical consumer debt case. However if you are the sole owner of the LLC, and personal or business assets are at risk, consult with a bankruptcy attorney.",
